# Idea
The main idea here is to form an application which will communicate and connect with a third-party application wherein exchange of data and information will be purely between the sender and the receiver.

# About
In the world where data is new oil, the safety for the same is of utmost priority. However in the past weâ€™ve had several data breaches that have come into light, which have raised some relevant concerns. To counter such scenarios we need to have a more secure way of exchanging sensitive data and confidential information. So we, team classio_nerds, are trying to build a software component Qboard Secure which is reliable enough to communicate over the net in a safe and sound environment.
