# Idea
The main idea here is to form an application which will communicate and connect with a third-party application wherein exchange of data and information will be purely between the sender and the receiver.

# About
In the world where data is new oil, the safety for the same is of utmost priority. However in the past we’ve had several data breaches that have come into light, which have raised some relevant concerns. To counter such scenarios we need to have a more secure way of exchanging sensitive data and confidential information. So we, team classio_nerds, are trying to build a software component Qboard Secure which is reliable enough to communicate over the net in a safe and sound environment.
